			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>The purpose of my site is to create a functioning photo portfolio where I can display, upload, and delete photos for my audience and clients to be able to view images.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>My audience consists of current and potential clients to be able to view past or current photography work. This is only going to allow people to view images that I can upload or delete. I would want user authentication to allow certain users to download their own portfolios.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>Some dynamic elements that would be using JavaScript would be image gallery sliders, review rotation, modal popups for viewing larger versions of photos, and interactive forms for uploading or deleting photos. Additionally, I would implement user authentication features for certain clients to log in and access their private galleries.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h2>Branding</h2>
			<h3>Website Logo</h3>
			<!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

			<!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			<h2>Wireframes</h2>
			<p>
				Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
				here
			</p>

			<h3>Home</h3>
			<p>
				The home page includes a welcome message with my name and a main portrait image that introduces my style. The dark section under the hero is for a short slogan that represents my brand. Below that, there's a review section that will rotate reviews. The next section highlights a favorite photo from a recent shoot, with a short description and button linking to the portfolio page. Footer includes copyright info and social media links.  
			</p>
			<img src="photos/HomeScreenWireFrame.png" alt="home page wireframe" />

			<h3>Portfolio</h3>
			<p>
				The portfolio page is organized into a grid layout showing featured photos from each portfolio. Each image block includes a placeholder for the portfolio name. The page begins with an intro text and short paragraph explaining what the user is viewing. The images are uniform in size and aligned in two columns. Footer includes copyright and social media links.
